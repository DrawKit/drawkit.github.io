<h1>Design Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#design-philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The design of DrawKit is very much driven by the classic 80/20 rule - its defaults and design decisions are intended to cover the 80% of typical uses with minimal set-up or configuration. If you find yourself in the other 20%, you&#8217;ll need to do a little more work, typically, and the more specialised your needs the more you&#8217;ll have to do. It&#8217;s inevitable that DrawKit cannot provide the perfect solution for all possible apps, even within the arena of vector drawing, since every programmer will have different needs.</p>
<p>One thing that is true of nearly every class, is that they will &#8220;just work&#8221; with little or no set-up. A high proportion of objects require a straightforward alloc + init to instantiate, with very few requiring complicated designated initializers. Most classes have convenient construction methods to further simplify instantiation for the majority. Of course, these objects may not &#8220;just work&#8221; how you want them to in this state, but at least they will generally do <em>something</em> useful, and any further set up you need to do is really a case of moving them away from their default states. The point of this is to give the user of DrawKit an easier time - instead of wondering if you have marshalled a whole lot of configuration parameters in just the right way to get a working object, you simply start with a working object and gradually adapt it to your needs. It should help give confidence in the framework and be much less error prone. Most development proceeds iteratively, so typically you&#8217;ll start with a working, but probably non-optimal object, and one step at a time change it to do what you want, testing each time or after each few changes. This way it&#8217;s much easier to pick up a problem than if you had to start with many tens of settings &#8220;up front&#8221; . This philosophy reaches its zenith with the complete automatic instantiation of an entire working system by a view if you don&#8217;t do it for it. It&#8217;s also typical of much of Cocoa itself.</p>
<p>While DrawKit has many classes that need to be assembled logically to build a working system, in general there&#8217;s not usually a strict order for doing things.</p>
<p>For example, you could add a layer to a drawing, then add objects to the layer - or build a layer complete with objects and add it to the drawing. It&#8217;s up to you. It&#8217;s a similar story when styles are assembled from collections of rasterizers - order of assembly isn&#8217;t too critical.</p>
