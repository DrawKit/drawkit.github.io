Source Code Format
==================

DrawKit's source code has been formatted using the `uncrustify`_ tool. Using this tool and a published configuration is designed to keep the code clean, consistent, and the project itself free of code style arguments.

.. _uncrustify: http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net

The easiest way to install the source code formatter is with brew::

	brew install Uncrustify


The source code configuration used by DrawKit is based on https://gist.github.com/m2orris/5297267
