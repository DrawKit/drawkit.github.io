Drawing Information Layer
-------------------------

`DKDrawingInfoLayer` is a layer class which displays a single panel of information in a nominated corner of the drawing. By default it uses some of the metadata of `DKDrawing` to display a drawing number, the name of the draughtsperson, the date and so forth. If you have a use for this, you'll probably have your own scheme for drawing numbers, etc, and so this layer is really just a demonstration of how that can work.
