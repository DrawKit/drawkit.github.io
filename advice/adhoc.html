<p>DrawKit may find a good home in many applications that are not complete drawing applications. For example you might just have a dialog that pops up and allows you to define some quick graphic that you can use elsewhere. DrawKit is a good basis for these types of editors - you may not be using much of its power but it doesn&#8217;t greatly add to your application&#8217;s waistline or complexity, while still offering a lot of features &#8220;for free&#8221; if you want them.</p>
<p>Deploying DrawKit is basically always the same process - create a <cite>DKDrawing</cite>, a <cite>DKDrawingView</cite> or some other interface, and bind them together with a <cite>DKViewController</cite> or subclass. You can do this manually whenever and wherever you want.</p>
<p>There is another way however - you can let <cite>DKDrawingView</cite> do all the work. If a <cite>DKDrawingView</cite> is instantiated (from a nib, for example) and it gets as far as having its drawRect: method called with no drawing in place, it will create one, add a controller and stitch it all together. The view owns the drawing, in this case (the design of the controller prevents any awkward retain cycles). The drawing&#8217;s initial size is set to the view&#8217;s bounds, and is complete with a grid layer, a guide layer, and one drawable object layer ready to go. It has a tool controller set with the select/edit tool and works immediately. Of course you&#8217;ll probably want to tweak this setup, but at least the majority of the initial configuration is done. You can also override <cite>DKDrawingView</cite>&#8216;s createAutoDrawing method to make the drawing differently, or modify the default one. This mechanism is intended to mirror the functional concept of <cite>NSTextView</cite> - you add the view and it creates a fully operational text editor. Likewise, <cite>DKDrawingView</cite> implements a fully operational drawing editor, just by adding the view.</p>
